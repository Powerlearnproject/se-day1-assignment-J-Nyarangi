#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.__

Answer: Software engineering is defined as the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. Software engineering is essential in the technology industry because it drives the creation of software applications and systems that are integral to fields such as communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer: 
1.The development of programming languages which allows developers to write instructions for computers more efficiently.
2.The establishment of software engineering as a discipline since there was growing complexity of software which highlighted the need for a formalized approach and this marked the beginning of structured methods and frameworks to improve software quality.
3.The rise of Agile methodologies which brought more iterative and flexible approaches to software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements Gathering: User needs and system requirements are collected and documented.
2. Design: Based on the requirements, detailed designs are created outlining how the software will work including architecture, interface design.
3. Implementation: Writing code for the software based on the design specifications.
4. Testing: Testing the software to fix any bugs ensuring it meets the requirements and the functionality expected.
5. Deployment:Realising the software for users in a live production environment.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next and emphasizes thorough documentation and planning at the beginning of the project. It is best suited for industries with strict regulations like healthcare where documentation and traceability are crucial.
The Agile methodology is iterative and flexible approach that breaks down projects into small,manageable increments known as sprints with continuous feedback from stakeholders at each stage. It is best suited for projects where requirements are likely to change and need regular adjustments ie mobile apps, web applications.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g., Git, Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1.Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2.Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3.Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1.Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software. THis helps in catching small, isolated bugs early.
2.Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.This helps to find and address issues with how components work together.
3.System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. This provides an end to end assessment of the software's performance.
4.Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This ensures that the final product meets user expectaions and business requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering helps avoid getting vague and confusing answers by making questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what is needed and gives a more precise answer.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Tell me about cancer"
Improved prompt: " Describe the main difference between benign and malignant tumors in cancers, including how they spread and potential treatment options."
The improved prompt is more effective because it has a clear focus, guiding the AI to provide targeted information instead of a broad overview. This specificity leads to a more precise, relevant, and informative response.
